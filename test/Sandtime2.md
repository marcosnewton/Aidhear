# Sand time session
Sand time sessions are a very efficient way to work. Focus on 25 minutes and then take a short break to relax. After four sessions, take a break of 15 to 20 minutes. This approach can greatly increase energy, stimulate creativity, and enhance your sense of accomplishment.

# Beautiful interface
Sand time lets you focus on the most important things. Its design is uncompromising, easy to use and easy to use. Once you start using it, you can quickly and intuitively master its functions.
