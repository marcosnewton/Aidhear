Aidhear Hearing Aid is a simple, easy-to-use application that allows you to filter noise and amplify sound in different environments. It uses the microphone on the phone to intercept the sound, allowing you to customize the adjustment of the different frequencies and adjust the background noise. After digital signal processing, the sound effect is clearly displayed on the headphones.

Aidhear hearing aids use the most advanced digital signal processing engine to adjust different frequency bands. Users can make appropriate adjustments and modifications in different places according to their needs, so that they can be used in your daily activities, so that you can enjoy a clearer dialogue.
